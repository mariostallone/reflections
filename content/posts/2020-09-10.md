In today’s Gospel, Jesus talks to us about loving our enemies

_“But I say to you that listen, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you.” -_ _Luke_  _6:27-28_ _(__NRSV-CI__)_

The two most important commandments that Jesus called out was to love your Lord and God with all your heart and the next commandment was to love your neighbour as yourself. Now Jesus takes it a notch above and tells us that we must love our enemies. When were think about this it’s definitely tough for us to  love our enemies. Forget love, it even easy for us to smile at our enemies. We’re faced with situations in our lives where people tend to be rude to us. They treat us differently because of how we look, how we speak, dress, etc. Many a time we want to punch the people who treat us that way. But here Jesus is asking us to love them. He says

_“If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.” - Luke_ _6:32_  _(NRSV-CI)_

So we, as Christians are called to a higher form of living. We should learn to love, even our enemies! It’s tough, and we can only do this through the grace of Christ.

May God give us the grace to love our enemies, and the people who harm or hurt us, just as Jesus did.

God Bless and have a great day!
