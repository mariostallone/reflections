_Can I not do with you, O house of Israel, just as this potter has done? says the Lord. Just like the clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel. Jeremiah 18:6 (NRSVCE)_

The part about the today’s Liturgy that struck me ware these words from God to Jeremiah. God is the Potter and we are the clay. We might have melded ourselves into an indistingusihable shape, but God wants to shape us into something new and wonderful.
