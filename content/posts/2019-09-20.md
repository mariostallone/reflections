**Romans 8:31-39**
In Romans 8 31 to 39 we hear Paul saying who can separate us from Christ who can separate us from the love of God which we have in Jesus Christ our Lord.

He talks about trials and tribulations persecution anguish hunger us from above powers from below neither death nonlife no spiritual powers neither the present know the future nothing can separate us from the love of God.

**Luke 9:23-26**
And then on the cost will be here Jesus say what does a profit anyone to gain the whole world and lose your forfeit his very life just little before that we hear if anyone would be a follower of mine let him deny himself and take up his cross and each day and follow me for anyone who wants to save his life will lose it and anyone who loses his life for my sake will save it now when we type this in with the reading that we just read but it talks about Jesus’s life in the first reading Jesus is love for us and then we tied into the cost Bilborough talks about us leaving I lives for Jesus talks about a covenant.

In the first reading the leaderboard God‘s love for us and how we can never be separated from that love because of Jesus Christ his death on the cross 45 third and me each and and Paul is so confident about 820 says that I know that there is nothing that can separate us from the love of God.

Then Jesus says anyone would be a follower of mine let him deny himself and take up his cross each day and follow me. This is quite profound this would mean that we are not living for ourselves we are leaving Jesus we would like we have given we have to look at giving our lives for Jesus by spending every moment of our lives for him. Neeraj and Jesus has further anyone who wants to save his life and losing any new man who loses his life for my sake will have it will save it what is it profit anyone to K in the world world in loose of forfeit his very life if someone feels ashamed of me of my what is the son of man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the delivery of his father with his holy Angels truly I said you that as I’m standing here who will not experienced it before we see the kingdom of God.

Contrasting these two passages one for the first reading in the second one from the cost will begin space we how we first hear about causing love for us and then the second part is divided it acquires our action now many a time we hear about cost bills being preached I mean we hear about the word of God being preached only from the perspective of Jesus is love and how wonderful it is and how God loves us so much yes it is true but we also need to remember that is the duty in each one of us for each one of us we cannot just stop by this except in God’s love if we really want to have eternal life we need to also do our part the part that God is called as for the need to deny ourselves.

We live in a world where it easy to except it is very difficult to give most a lot of the suffering in this world is because of people just being selfish look at the old people around all the young couple is the young men left their parents history all these old people who were once citizens in this world I met an old woman last of the afternoon yesterday when I was having a pizza and pizza was a little too much for me to have so I took a couple slices to go and give it to her and I was looking actually for someone to give it and that’s when I saw her she was sitting there outside having collected plastic bottles and what not anything and everything that she could collect so that she could lead a reasonable life. Mushy have not had some dignity when she was a lot younger what is Shiva been waiting the best of clothes in walking around and I do not know but I guess she might of had she does have children as well but when I saw her standing over them sitting over there extremely alone all by yourself at the lack food it hurt me and attend that got me thinking today when I was just reading this world we all just love to accept Jesus is love we talk about what a wonderful saviour that he is in everything that he gives us and the role in this excepting mode but once we stop and think about what does it really mean to gain eternal life to be with him it requires more than that coach can I love as it respective of what we. Got is going to love us respect of what we do is never as you know even a small reason forgot to this like us are not lovers this and we got cannot hours he will have a syllabuses it’s a party for well we need to do I have you know why we need to give up our own lives for God we deny ourselves the pleasure of being the masters of our life when we all went up and let all the grounds and we said God you are my master it was a reminder for us to know that Jesus is in control of my life scores today’s reading in the cost will disperse the things in perspective when it says that unless we had truly making
