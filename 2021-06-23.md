[Genesis 15:1-12, 17-18; Psalms 105:1-4, 6-9; Matthew 7:15-20]

_“Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.”_
_“A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus you will know them by their fruits.” - Matthew 7:15,18-20 (NRSV)_

In today’s Gospel, we read Jesus warning us about false prophets, and He gives us a clear means of discerning who is a false prophet. Jesus tells us that we would know them by their fruits.

The same principle applies to us as well. Jesus talks about the fruit we bear, which determines who we are, and what our true intentions are. A good way for us to discern if we are following His will in our lives is to look at the fruit it bears.

We all use the word ministry to refer to the work we do for God. But an important thing to note is that the work that God has called us specifically to do, the work that only you can do, is your ministry. We can fall into the trap of doing things that although are ordered towards God, may not be what God has called us to do. How do you discern this seemingly good deed to be from God? I believe we can apply the same principle of looking at the fruit that the ministry brings, both on your lives and the people involved- both the beneficiaries as well as your partners. If it is from God, it truly will flourish and bear fruit.

So let’s be cautious of heeding to false prophets and test them by looking at their fruits. Let’s also look deep within and look into our lives to see what aspects of our lives bear fruit and what doesn’t. Let’s take them to the Lord and ask Him to weed out the parts of our life that are not from Him.

God Bless and have a great day!
