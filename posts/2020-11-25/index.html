<p>[Revelation 15:1-4; Psalms 98:1-3, 7-9; Luke 21:12-19]</p>
<p><em>“But before all this occurs, they will arrest you and persecute you; they will hand you over to synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors because of my name. This will give you an opportunity to testify. So make up your minds not to prepare your defense in advance; for I will give you words and a wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to withstand or contradict. You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers, by relatives and friends; and they will put some of you to death. You will be hated by all because of my name. But not a hair of your head will perish. By your endurance you will gain your souls. - Luke 21:12-19 (NRSV)</em></p>
<p>In today’s Gospel Jesus continues to talk about the end times.</p>
<p>The Christian Faith is by no means an easy faith to follow. We all are presented with two paths, the easier, worldly path, where we follow along with what the people of the world do, and the path that leads to life. The path that leads to life is usually a narrow path because it’s not easy to take it. Jesus in today’s Gospel once again reminds us of the fact that we will face persecution, rejection.. for believing in Him. But He also gives us the promise that not a hair of our head will perish. He’s promising us hereof eternal life!</p>
<p>The world we live in makes it easy for us to fall astray. The temptation to fall into sin, and walk away from Christ, is ripe right around us. The path of righteousness, the path of truth, always seems like the less attractive path to take. But true joy and happiness come from Christ. The lifestyle of this world is not sustainable and leads to destruction. We read in Matthew 7:13-14</p>
<p><em>“Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.</em></p>
<p>Jesus also says in today’s Gospel <em>I will give you words and a wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to withstand or contradict.</em> He’s referring to the grace of the Holy Spirit here. God gave us the Holy Spirit to live and dwell in us, to give us counsel, wisdom, knowledge, grace and strength to withstand and bear testament to His name!</p>
<p>Let us remember this, and keep our eyes focussed on Jesus. Let us consider it a privilege to testify for Jesus, to shine light on the world!</p>
<p>God Bless and have a great day!</p>
