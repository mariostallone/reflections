      <description>[Revelation 1:1-4; 2:1-5; Psalms 1:1-4, 6; Luke 18:35-43]
“What do you want me to do for you?” He said, “Lord, let me see again.” Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has saved you.” Immediately he regained his sight and followed him, glorifying God; and all the people, when they saw it, praised God. - Luke 18:41-43 (NRSVCE)
Today&amp;rsquo;s Gospel is quite interesting. We see a blind man regain his sight.</description>

      <description>[2 John 4-9; Psalms 119:1-2, 10-11, 17-18; Luke 17:26-37]
Just as it was in the days of Noah, so too it will be in the days of the Son of Man. They were eating and drinking, and marrying and being given in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed all of them. Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lot: they were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building, but on the day that Lot left Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed all of them —it will be like that on the day that the Son of Man is revealed.</description>

      <description>[Philemon 7-20; Psalms 146:7-10; Luke 17:20-25]
Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming, he answered them, &amp;ldquo;The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed; nor will they say, Lo, here it is!&#39; or There!&#39; for behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you.&amp;rdquo; - Luke 17:20-21 (NRSVCE)
In today’s Gospel, we hear Jesus speak more about the Kingdom as well as His death and resurrection.</description>

      <description>[Titus 3:1-7; Psalms 23:1-6; Luke 17:11-19]
Then Jesus asked, “Were not ten made clean? But the other nine, where are they? Was none of them found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?” - Luke 17:17-18 (NRSVCE)
In today’s Gospel, we read about the ten lepers who were cleaned. They all came to Jesus and called out to Him to have mercy on them. Jesus tells them to go and show themselves to the priests, and as they were doing as He told them to, they were cleaned.</description>

      <description>[Titus 2:1-8, 11-14; Psalms 37:3-4, 18, 23, 27, 29; Luke 17:7-10]
So you also, when you have done all that you were ordered to do, say, ‘We are worthless slaves; we have done only what we ought to have done!’” - Luke 17:10 (NRSVCE)
Today’s Gospel can sound a bit difficult to read at first glance. An important prelude to this is what comes in the previous verses, where the disciples ask Jesus, How to increase their faith?</description>

Making a whip of cords, he drove all of them out of the temple, both the sheep and the cattle. He also poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. He told those who were selling the doves, “Take these things out of here! Stop making my Father’s house a marketplace!” - John 2:15-16 (NRSVCE)</description>

      <description>[Philippians 3:17–4:1; Psalms 122:1-5; Luke 16:1-8]
And his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly; for the children of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light. - Luke 16:8 (NRSVCE)
In today’s Gospel, we read about the dishonest steward. A steward is someone who has been appointed on behalf of another - a monarch, a rich man, etc.</description>

      <description>[Wisdom of Solomon 3:1-9; Psalms 23:1-6; John 6:37-40]
“But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and no torment will ever touch them. In the eyes of the foolish they seemed to have died, and their departure was thought to be a disaster, and their going from us to be their destruction; but they are at peace.” - Wisdom 3:1-3 (NRSV-CI)
In today’s reading, we hear once again about death and eternity.</description>

      <description>[Philippians 2:12-18; Psalms 27:1, 4, 13-14; Luke 14:25-33]
“Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple. Whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my disciple. - Luke 14:26-27 (NRSVCE)
Today’s Gospel sounds a rather radical statement by Christ. When we read it at first glance, it comes off as odd, and we might wonder what is Jesus asking of us!</description>

      <description>[Philippians 2:5-11; Psalms 22:26-32; Luke 14:15-24]
Then the master said to the slave, ‘Go out into the roads and lanes, and compel people to come in, so that my house may be filled. For I tell you, none of those who were invited will taste my dinner.’” - Luke 14:23-24 (NRSVCE)
In today’s Gospel, we read The Parable of the Great Dinner. The gist of the story is that a man once hosted a great dinner and invited many.</description>

Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me, even though they die, will live, and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?” - John 11:25-27 (NRSVCE)
Today the church celebrates All Souls Day, and we are called to pray for our near and dear ones who passed away from this Earth.</description>

      <description>[Philippians 1:1-11; Psalms 111:1-6; Luke 14:1-6]
And this is my prayer, that your love may overflow more and more with knowledge and full insight to help you to determine what is best, so that in the day of Christ you may be pure and blameless, having produced the harvest of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ for the glory and praise of God. - Philippians 1:9-11 (NRSVCE)
Today&amp;rsquo;s First Reading is the salutation from the Letter of St.</description>

      <description>[Ephesians 6:10-20; Psalms 144:1-2, 9-10; Luke 13:31-35]
Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his power. Put on the whole armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For our struggle is not against enemies of blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.</description>

      <description>[Ephesians 2:19-22; Psalms 19:2-5; Luke 6:12-16]
So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are citizens with the saints and also members of the household of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone. In him the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are built together spiritually into a dwelling place for God.</description>

      <description>[Ephesians 5:21-33; Psalms 128:1-5; Luke 13:18-21]
He said therefore, “What is the kingdom of God like? And to what should I compare it? It is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in the garden; it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air made nests in its branches.” And again he said, “To what should I compare the kingdom of God? It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.</description>

      <description>[Ephesians 4:32–5:8; Psalms 1:1-4, 6; Luke 13:10-17]
“You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger, and lead it away to give it water? And ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen long years, be set free from this bondage on the sabbath day?” - Luke 13:15b-16 (NRSVCE)
In today’s Gospel, we hear of Jesus healing a crippled woman.</description>

      <description>[Ephesians 3:14-21; Psalms 33:1-2, 4-5, 11-12, 18-19; Luke 12:49-53]
From now on five in one household will be divided, three against two and two against three; they will be divided: father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.” - Luke 12:52-53 (NRSVCE)
Today’s Gospel reading seems very harsh and when read at face value makes you wonder what Jesus is telling us.</description>

      <description>[Ephesians 2:12-22; Psalms 85:9-14; Luke 12:35-38]
“Be dressed for action and have your lamps lit; be like those who are waiting for their master to return from the wedding banquet, so that they may open the door for him as soon as he comes and knocks. Blessed are those slaves whom the master finds alert when he comes; truly I tell you, he will fasten his belt and have them sit down to eat, and he will come and serve them.</description>

      <description>[Ephesians 2:1-10; Psalms 100:2-5; Luke 12:13-21]
You were dead through the trespasses and sins in which you once lived, following the course of this world, following the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work among those who are disobedient…. …For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God— not the result of works, so that no one may boast.</description>

      <description>[Daniel 7:9-10, 13-14; Psalms 138:1-5; John 1:47-51]
Nathanael asked him, “Where did you get to know me?” Jesus answered, “I saw you under the fig tree before Philip called you.” - John 1:48 (NRSVCE)
In today’s Gospel, we see Jesus calling Philip and Nathaniel. IF you read a few verses before this, you’ll find that Jesus had called Philip, and Philip then called Nathaniel. When Nathaniel meets Jesus, He welcomes him and tells him that He saw him under the fig tree before Philip called him.</description>

For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven:

a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted; - Ecclesiastes 3:1-2 (NRSVCE)
Today’s First Reading is one of my favourite verses in the Bible. I love the poetry in it, and the truth and deep meaning in it.</description>

Then he said to them all, “If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me. For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will save it. What does it profit them if they gain the whole world, but lose or forfeit themselves?</description>

      <description>[1 Corinthians 12:31&amp;ndash;13:13; Psalms 33:2-5, 12, 22; Luke 7:31-35]
Love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 (NRSVCE)
Today’s First reading is one of my all-time favourite readings in the Bible.</description>

      <description>[Hebrews 5:7-9; Psalms 31:2-6,15-16,20; John 19:25-27]
“When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside her, he said to his mother, “Woman, here is your son.” Then he said to the disciple, “Here is your mother.” And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.” - John 19:26-27 (NRSV-CI)
In today’s Gospel we read about the final minutes of Jesus as a human being in this Earth.</description>

      <description>In today’s Gospel, Jesus talks to us about loving our enemies
“But I say to you that listen, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you.” - Luke 6:27-28 (NRSV-CI)
The two most important commandments that Jesus called out was to love your Lord and God with all your heart and the next commandment was to love your neighbour as yourself.</description>
