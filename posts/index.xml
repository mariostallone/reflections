      <description>[Revelation 1:1-4; 2:1-5; Psalms 1:1-4, 6; Luke 18:35-43]
“What do you want me to do for you?” He said, “Lord, let me see again.” Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has saved you.” Immediately he regained his sight and followed him, glorifying God; and all the people, when they saw it, praised God. - Luke 18:41-43 (NRSVCE)
Today&amp;rsquo;s Gospel is quite interesting. We see a blind man regain his sight.</description>

      <description>[2 John 4-9; Psalms 119:1-2, 10-11, 17-18; Luke 17:26-37]
Just as it was in the days of Noah, so too it will be in the days of the Son of Man. They were eating and drinking, and marrying and being given in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed all of them. Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lot: they were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building, but on the day that Lot left Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed all of them —it will be like that on the day that the Son of Man is revealed.</description>

      <description>[Philemon 7-20; Psalms 146:7-10; Luke 17:20-25]
Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming, he answered them, &amp;ldquo;The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed; nor will they say, Lo, here it is!&#39; or There!&#39; for behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you.&amp;rdquo; - Luke 17:20-21 (NRSVCE)
In today’s Gospel, we hear Jesus speak more about the Kingdom as well as His death and resurrection.</description>

      <description>[Titus 3:1-7; Psalms 23:1-6; Luke 17:11-19]
Then Jesus asked, “Were not ten made clean? But the other nine, where are they? Was none of them found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?” - Luke 17:17-18 (NRSVCE)
In today’s Gospel, we read about the ten lepers who were cleaned. They all came to Jesus and called out to Him to have mercy on them. Jesus tells them to go and show themselves to the priests, and as they were doing as He told them to, they were cleaned.</description>

      <description>[Titus 2:1-8, 11-14; Psalms 37:3-4, 18, 23, 27, 29; Luke 17:7-10]
So you also, when you have done all that you were ordered to do, say, ‘We are worthless slaves; we have done only what we ought to have done!’” - Luke 17:10 (NRSVCE)
Today’s Gospel can sound a bit difficult to read at first glance. An important prelude to this is what comes in the previous verses, where the disciples ask Jesus, How to increase their faith?</description>

      <description>[Ezekiel 47:1-2, 8-9, 12; Psalms 46:2-3, 5-6, 8-9; 1 Corinthians 3:9-11, 16-17; John 2:13-22]
Making a whip of cords, he drove all of them out of the temple, both the sheep and the cattle. He also poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. He told those who were selling the doves, “Take these things out of here! Stop making my Father’s house a marketplace!” - John 2:15-16 (NRSVCE)</description>

      <description>[Philippians 3:17–4:1; Psalms 122:1-5; Luke 16:1-8]
And his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly; for the children of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light. - Luke 16:8 (NRSVCE)
In today’s Gospel, we read about the dishonest steward. A steward is someone who has been appointed on behalf of another - a monarch, a rich man, etc.</description>

      <description>[Wisdom of Solomon 3:1-9; Psalms 23:1-6; John 6:37-40]
“But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and no torment will ever touch them. In the eyes of the foolish they seemed to have died, and their departure was thought to be a disaster, and their going from us to be their destruction; but they are at peace.” - Wisdom 3:1-3 (NRSV-CI)
In today’s reading, we hear once again about death and eternity.</description>

      <description>[Philippians 2:12-18; Psalms 27:1, 4, 13-14; Luke 14:25-33]
“Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple. Whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my disciple. - Luke 14:26-27 (NRSVCE)
Today’s Gospel sounds a rather radical statement by Christ. When we read it at first glance, it comes off as odd, and we might wonder what is Jesus asking of us!</description>

      <description>[Philippians 2:5-11; Psalms 22:26-32; Luke 14:15-24]
Then the master said to the slave, ‘Go out into the roads and lanes, and compel people to come in, so that my house may be filled. For I tell you, none of those who were invited will taste my dinner.’” - Luke 14:23-24 (NRSVCE)
In today’s Gospel, we read The Parable of the Great Dinner. The gist of the story is that a man once hosted a great dinner and invited many.</description>

Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me, even though they die, will live, and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?” - John 11:25-27 (NRSVCE)
Today the church celebrates All Souls Day, and we are called to pray for our near and dear ones who passed away from this Earth.</description>

      <description>[Philippians 1:1-11; Psalms 111:1-6; Luke 14:1-6]
And this is my prayer, that your love may overflow more and more with knowledge and full insight to help you to determine what is best, so that in the day of Christ you may be pure and blameless, having produced the harvest of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ for the glory and praise of God. - Philippians 1:9-11 (NRSVCE)
Today&amp;rsquo;s First Reading is the salutation from the Letter of St.</description>

      <description>[Ephesians 6:10-20; Psalms 144:1-2, 9-10; Luke 13:31-35]
Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his power. Put on the whole armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For our struggle is not against enemies of blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.</description>
