&nbsp;</div></header><p>[Hebrews 10:11-18; Psalms 110:1-4; Mark 4:1-20]</p><p><em>“Listen! A sower went out to sow. And as he sowed, some seed fell on the path, and the birds came and ate it up. Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and it sprang up quickly, since it had no depth of soil. And when the sun rose, it was scorched; and since it had no root, it withered away. Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain. Other seed fell into good soil and brought forth grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirty and sixty and a hundredfold.” - Mark 4:3-8 (NRSV)</em></p><p>In today’s Gospel, we read about the Parable of the Sower.</p><p>Jesus goes on to explain the parable to his disciples, talking about how the word of God is received. He talks about the 4 places where the seeds fall 1. The Path; 2. Rocky Ground; 3. Thorns; 4. Good Soil. An important take away for me here is that we all journey between these 4 places. Many of us have had to journey from the pathway to good soil. Some perhaps from rocky ground or thorns onto good soil. An important thought that came to me about our journeys are, as to how or why we are in such a state? Our circumstances largely dictate where we are in our journey.</p><p>This brings me to the important topic of who we surround ourselves with. All of us have friends and family and surround ourselves with them. Our view of the world is largely shaped by them. We also are influenced by people we look up to. So let me put all of these people under the bucket of influencers. Unlike Social Media Influencers, these influencers are our influencers, the ones that shape our thoughts and decisions! We subscribe to the thought patterns of these influencers. We listen to them. We can be moved by them. For instance when we’re surrounded by agnostic or atheistic influencers in our lives, we colour every message we receive with that filter, and it makes us difficult to digest the Gospel. We all should have only one influencer - Jesus Christ. But that&rsquo;s a journey, and that journey comes through us pruning away our circle of influence and balancing it with the right set of people.</p><p>When we’re surrounded primarily by worldly people, anytime you go for a retreat or have something spectacular to share about Jesus, you might be shot down, or more often, you’d be hesitant to share your experiences. For a large part of my life, I was surrounded by friends who were non-believing, and who couldn’t understand my beliefs. I was blessed to have a family who had strong Christian values, and so my influential circle became balanced. But as I grew my friends circle to have more Christian friends, I was able to share my faith more, and I was heavily influenced to keep my prime influencer as Jesus. It’s not that I have abandoned any of my non-believing friends, it’s that I included Christian friends in my circle.</p><p>We need to have a community of believers - the church. We all need to find our group of influencers. Look at your circle of influence, and if you find yourself lacking Christian companionship, go and seek out youth groups, young adult groups, prayer groups, etc. where you can expand your sphere of influence with Christians who will egg you on. And don&rsquo;t forget, you too can be an influence in someone else’s life. So let your non-believing friends see the light in you too!</p><p>God Bless and have a great day!</p><footer><hr><div class=post-tags></div></footer><div class=comments></div></article></body><div class=foot></div></html>
