<p>[Jeremiah 15:10, 16-21; Psalms 59:2-4, 10-11, 17-18; John 11:19-27]</p>
<p><em>Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me, even though they die, will live, and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?” - John 11:25-26 (NRSVCE)</em></p>
<p>IN Today’s Gospel we see Jesus raise Lazarus from the dead. The words above were spoken by Jesus when Martha tells Jesus that he could saved her brother, had He come earlier. Martha still did not understand what Jesus could do. She throught he could only heal the living, but Jesus tells here that He is the ressurection adn the life. These words are one of th emost pivotal words in all of Christianity. It hinges on the core of our beleifs.</p>
<p>And we see how these words come to fruition, as Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead. The people around needed to see and beleive that Jesus is God, that He is the messiah, and raising Lazarus, definitely opened the eyes of the people around.</p>
<p>I wonder what Lazarus must have felt like to be raised again, and also where was he for those 4 days that he was dead. What a profound expereince it must have been for Lazarus to be the man who was raised from death. Lazarus’ life can be treated as a metaphor to our own lives. We all feel dead inside at times, and we need to be raised up by Jesus so we can live again. So we can be strong testaments to Christs love in our lives.</p>
<p>God Bless and have a great day!</p>
