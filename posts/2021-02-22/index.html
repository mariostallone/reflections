<p>[1 Peter 5:1-4; Psalms 23:1-6; Matthew 16:13-19]</p>
<p><em>He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.” And Jesus answered him, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.” - Matthew 16:15-19 (NRSV)</em></p>
<p>In today’s Gospel, we read about Jesus asking His disciples who do the people say He is. And He then goes on to ask them who do they say He is. To this Simon, inspired by the Holy Spirit, exclaims - You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.</p>
<p>Simon Peter was a fisherman. He was called by Jesus, and heeding Jesus’ call, he follows Him. In those days, and perhaps even now, fishermen, are not necessarily learned men. They knew of their trade, and they live a life in the sea. They were not necessarily of high stature as the Pharisees or traders in the land. The Jewish Rabbis who were all too read in the Torah did not recognise the Messiah, but a fisherman did. We all know how the power of the Holy Spirit rested on Peter after Jesus death and resurrection, and we know how Peter, is indeed the rock on which our Catholic Church is built. Peter became our first Pope!</p>
<p>The part that caught my attention was about Why and How did Peter have this truth of Jesus being the Messiah, and not the learned Rabbis! Peter might not have had access to the scripture. He would’ve only heard it preached to him. Yet, we see how magnificent his faith was, that the Holy Spirit revealed to him who Jesus was. He had heart knowledge. His simpleton way of believing and having faith, lead him to become the rock on which our church is built.</p>
<p>We live in a day and age, where knowledge is freely available. We’re all well educated, and we have access to information, far more easily than any other generation that ever lived. Yet, we find it difficult to accept the truth of the Gospel. One might argue that this abundance of knowledge makes it difficult for us to find the truth. On the contrary, its a matter of what we choose to read, what we choose to subscribe to, what we choose to believe. While we may choose to seek out answers to all the questions in our minds about God, we need to start by accepting Him first. There’s the knowledge that books and intellect can never give us, and that’s the knowledge that comes from accepting the Holy Spirit in our hearts, by being open to God working in our lives.</p>
<p>Let’s learn to keep our eyes and ears open to God’s call. Let’s not let our intellect and knowledge blind us from seeing and hearing the truth. Let’s learn to be as simple as Peter, and let God work in us, to make us complete. God Bless and have a great day!</p>
