&nbsp;</div></header><p>[Ephesians 2:1-10; Psalms 100:2-5; Luke 12:13-21]</p><p><em>You were dead through the trespasses and sins in which you once lived, following the course of this world, following the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work among those who are disobedient….
…For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God— not the result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are what he has made us, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand to be our way of life. - Ephesians 2:1-10 (NRSVCE)</em></p><p>Today’s First Reading so clearly tells us about what Salvation is, who we are in Christ! Paul writes that we were all dead by our transgressions. So the definition of death by Paul here is the absence of God in our lives or the absence of a connection with Christ. When we are in sin, we break our connection with Christ, and thereby we are dead! The death Paul refers to here is Spiritual Death. But as Christians, we know that Spiritual Death is far worse than Physical Death. He goes on to say, that we are saved by God’s mercy, through the death and sacrifice of Jesus, through our Faith. This verse goes on to expand how we can attain salvation. It’s through Faith, Faith in Christ, that He died for our sins. While Jesus paid the price on the cross for all humanity, God gives us a choice, that we may choose His saving grace. That’s what’s so beautiful about God’s love. He never imposes, We accept Him, of our own free will. We choose to lead a life according to His plan, out of our own free will. The important take away for me is this - As long as we are not in communion with God, the creator and master of the Universe, who loves us so much, we are dead, spiritually dead. Our lives on Earth, are meaningless without Christ.</p><p><em>Then he told them a parable: “The land of a rich man produced abundantly. And he thought to himself, ‘What should I do, for I have no place to store my crops?’ Then he said, ‘I will do this: I will pull down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.’ But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life is being demanded of you. And the things you have prepared, whose will they be?’ So it is with those who store up treasures for themselves but are not rich toward God.” - Luke 12:16-21 (NRSVCE)</em></p><p>Today’s Gospel so beautifully complements the readings. Jesus talks about a rich man, who kept storing up and was dependant on his life on Earth. He was storing up so he can be merry and be happy here. He didn’t seem to give to the poor. He didn&rsquo;t seem to give to God. He represents someone who in today&rsquo;s day, we&rsquo;d say was too focussed on their careers, on becoming rich on this Earth. But sadly, many people store up treasures and keep working, being focussed on Earthy treasures, that they forget to live here on Earth. They had no spiritual life due to the lack of being in communion with Christ, and then when the time came for them to leave this Earth, all that they had been stored up will be enjoyed by someone else. We all came to this Earth empty-handed, and empty-handed we will return. The only treasures we can ever take over to our Eternal abode is the spiritual treasures that we have gained through our Faith in Christ, that is the salvation and saving grace. Anything else, that we may gain on this Earth, that we may store up, is left behind.</p><p>We need to keep reminding ourselves that we are but pilgrims on this Earth! Let us pray and ask God to open our eyes more to His kingdom. More to His will in our lives, and that we may always accept Him, so that we may Live in Him!</p><p>God Bless and Have a great day!</p><footer><hr><div class=post-tags></div></footer><div class=comments></div></article></body><div class=foot></div></html>
