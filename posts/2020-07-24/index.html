&nbsp;</div></header><p>[Jeremiah 3:14-17; Jeremiah 31:10-13; Matthew 13:18-23]</p><p><em>But as for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty. - Matthew 13:23 (NRSVCE)</em></p><p>In Today’s Gospel Jesus explains to His disciples the Parable of the Sower. The Parable of the Sower very clearly explains to us, how we ought to receive the Word of God. We all should strive to be like the good soil, the one who hears the word and understands it, the one who bears fruit and yields more fruit.</p><p>An important aspect of the one who represents the good soil, in Jesus’ words, is of bearing fruit. Jesus does not stop to say the one who merely hears it and understands it. He specifically mentions bearing fruit and yielding fruit. What does this mean in the context of our lives, assuming we are all like the good soil? Does it mean, we bear fruit by transforming our lives alone? Or does it talk about spreading the love and making good soil of others? As Christians, our mission in life does not stop with transforming ourselves, cos if we stop there, we perhaps, are not bearing witness to the full definition of what Jesus spoke of as being the good soil. As Christians, we cannot but go out and spread the Word and have more people bear fruit in their lives. You received without payment; give without payment.</p><p>So let’s keep this in mind as we lead out lives, and transform ourselves. Let’s understand that good soil, according to Jesus bears more fruit, by spreading His love. Let’s try to reach out to the people in our lives, the people God has put in our lives, maybe our family, our friends, our colleagues,&mldr; and plant seeds in their lives, so that they too may bear fruit. Let&rsquo;s not stop there, and let&rsquo;s water the seed too. Let’s pray for them to be like the good soil, so that they too may bear fruit and multiply.</p><p>God Bless and have a great day!</p><footer><hr><div class=post-tags></div></footer><div class=comments></div></article></body><div class=foot></div></html>
