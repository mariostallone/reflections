It is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in the garden; it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air made nests in its branches.” And again he said, “To what should I compare the kingdom of God? It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.” - Luke 13:18-21 (NRSVCE)</em></p><p>Today’s Gospel contains what I’d call micro-parables. Jesus tells us two parables, that are meant to give us an idea of what the Kingdom of God is like.</p><p>Jesus says that the Kingdom of God is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in a garden. A mustard seed is so small, and a garden is so big, yet the mustard seed grows and blossoms into such a big tree when the ground is fertile, and enough water and nourishment has been given to it, it grows into a magnificent tree. Birds go and make nests in its branches. If we are the garden, and we let the Kingdom of God in the form of a seed, be planted in us when we nourish it and water it, it blossoms in us. We blossom and grow into magnificent trees, who can then shelter others.</p><p>In the parable of the yeast, Jesus talks once again about how the small amount of yeast that was taken to three measures of flour that then made the entire dough to be leavened. When we let the Kingdom of God work in us, we can be consumed by God, and be more like Him. We are the flour, and the yeast is the Kingdom of God, that works in us, to transform us.</p><p>In both these examples, the Kingdom of God starts small in us - a mustard seed and yeast. But when we let the Kingdom of God work in us, we blossom and we become mighty trees!</p><p>Take these parables in prayer, and see what God is telling you from these parables. Jesus spoke in parables because, there is more than one meaning we can derive from it, and when we let the Holy Spirit speak to us, through these parables, they’ll speak to you, in such a personal and profound manner.</p><p>God Bless and have a great day!</p><footer><hr><div class=post-tags></div></footer><div class=comments></div></article></body><div class=foot></div></html>
