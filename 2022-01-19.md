_David said, “The Lord, who saved me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, will save me from the hand of this Philistine.” So Saul said to David, “Go, and may the Lord be with you!”- 1 Samuel 17:37 (NRSVCE)_
In today’s First Reading, we read about the famous story of David defeating Goliath.

We’ve all probably read this multiple times in the form of a story, right from childhood, and it's portrayed multiple times in folklore as the underdog winning over the giant! While that is all true, what truly makes this a fantastic story, is merely how this is achieved by David. We see David’s bold confidence in God, and His protection when he tells Saul -

_The Lord, who saved me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, will save me from the hand of this Philistine._

This is called **Bold Faith**! We can see from this statement, that David had an intimate relationship with God, and He knew that God had his back. He recalls instances in his life, where God had come through for him and speaks boldly in Faith and confidence in God when he tells Saul that he would fight the Philistine. You don’t see him, citing his own strength, he instead counts on God’s protection.

Another interesting aspect for me here was his precise recollection of God having saved him in the past. This is a reminder for us to recollect the times God has blessed us in the past, in times of desolation. In times that we feel lonely, hurt, defeated or scared when the mountain above us seems immovable, let's remember to recollect what God has done for us, and then speak back at our problems, our fears, our Goliaths, and proclaim, that the God who took us through our past battles, will take us through all our future battles.

It’s a nice idea to have a gratitude journal, where you write down a few things God has done for you. If writing isn't easy, try to talk about the blessings God has done for you with your friends and family. Frequently remind yourself of the blessings God has showered on you, will helo you recollect it, in times of distress.

Let’s learn to have Bold Faith! God Bless and have a great day!
